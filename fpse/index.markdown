About FPSE
----------
The LFA is local 14 of the [Federation of Post-Secondary
Educators of BC (FPSE)](http://www.fpse.ca/).
With [19 member locals](http://www.fpse.ca/about/member-locals),
FPSE is
a federation of independent unions representing over 
10,000 faculty and staff at colleges and teaching 
universities across BC. FPSE offers services, advocacy, 
information and analysis about post-secondary education 
for its members and the general public. With a voting 
representative from every local, 
[Presidents’ Council](http://www.fpse.ca/about/governance/presidents-council) 
is FPSE's governing body between AGMs. The 
[Executive Committee](http://www.fpse.ca/about/governance/executive-committee)
advises and supports the work of Presidents’ Council.
