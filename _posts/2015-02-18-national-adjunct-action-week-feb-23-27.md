In Canada, about one third of all academic staff in post-secondary institutions are hired on a per course or limited-term basis.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.caut.ca/" target="_blank">CAUT</a> is lending support to its US counterparts during their National Adjunct Action Week (Feb. 23-27) and their walkout day on February 25. During the week, organizers across North America are using <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/National-Adjunct-Walkout-Day/340019999501000" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://nationaladjunct.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nawd?mode=photos" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and blogs to increase awareness of the inequities faced by contingent faculty members and the adverse impact on higher education.
