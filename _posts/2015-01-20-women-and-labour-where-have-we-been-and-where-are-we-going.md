<p>Where: <strong>SFU Harbour Centre (</strong>515 West Hastings Street, Vancouver)<strong> &ndash; Room 1400</strong></p>

<p>This event is intended to engage labour activists, new and experienced, in networking and strategizing towards goals to help strengthen our collective power and to oppose attacks on labour and working people. This panel of keen and dynamic union women leaders will speak about their experiences with union activism. How might we bring our knowledge and experience within our separate locals together to strengthen our strategies towards common goals? What stands in the way of building our capacity? What strengths do we currently hold that might be better utilized through collective actions? This event is for anyone interested in networking and coordinating with other unions and activists toward a stronger labour movement.</p>
