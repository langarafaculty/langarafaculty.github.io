	<p>Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 2950, representing 1,500 clerical, library and hospital staff at the University of British Columbia, has signed a tentative collective agreement.<br />
		The deal reached October 10 is for 0-0-2-2% wage increases over four years ending in 2014. This is the first tentative agreement reached at a BC university staffed by CUPE support workers in the current round of bargaining.</p>
	<p>Features of the deal are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			- No concessions</li>
		<li>
			- An additional 0.25% in the final year for workers at the Chan Centre to help move their wage grid more in line with industry standards</li>
		<li>
			- An Employment Insurance rebate to be placed on the wage grid</li>
		<li>
			- A revision of retirement language to include the right to work past age 65</li>
		<li>
			- Clarification of the status of temporary workers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The tentative agreement must still be ratified by the members of CUPE 2950 and approved by the provincial government. While not ecstatic, CUPE 2950 is recommending its members ratify the deal.</p>
	<p>The agreement is &quot;the best we can accomplish with the current university economic circumstances and political interference in BC,&quot; said Nancy Forhan, 2950&rsquo;s President in a press release. &quot;We are not ecstatic about this agreement - it does little to undo years of wage controls set by the BC Liberals.&quot;</p>
