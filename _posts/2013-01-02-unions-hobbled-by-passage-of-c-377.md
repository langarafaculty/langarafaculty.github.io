<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px"><font face="Lucida Grande" size="3">The latest victory of business-funded politics was recorded last week when the Harper Conservatives passed Bill C-377 aimed at hobbling the ability of trade unions to participate in public life.Bill C-377 rests on the proposition that because trade union dues are deductible from income reported by trade unionists at tax time, use of the money received as dues by unions needs to be fully disclosed in elaborated and detailed regular reports.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px"><font face="Lucida Grande" size="3">With its legislation (technically an amendment to the Income Tax Act), the Harper government is imposing new financial regulations that will add steep compliance costs and time-consuming administrative requirements to the normal activities of representing trade unionists.</font></p>
