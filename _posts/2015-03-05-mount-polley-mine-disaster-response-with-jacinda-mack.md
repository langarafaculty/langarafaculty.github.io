<p>On August 4, 2014, the Mount Polley Tailings Pond breached, releasing 25 million cubic meters of water and slurry into Polley Lake - causing one of the biggest environmental disasters in modern Canadian history.</p>

<p>Join Jacinda Mack, Mining Response Coordinator at the Northern Shuswap Tribal Council, as she discusses the Imperial Metals Mount Polley Mine tailings disaster and the contamination of the Quesnel River Basin, as well as the Northern Secwepemc response to the breach and its cleanup. This presentation asks for accountability in the extractives industry in this spill clean-up and encourages audiences to work toward maintaining water as a public trust in their own communities.</p>

Jacinda has her Masters in Communication and Culture from York University, has conducted research in self-government, and has experience protecting Indigenous land and advising on natural resources policy.</p>

The LFA Human Rights and International Solidarity Committee is proud to host Ms. Mack&#39;s presentation.</p>
