	<p jquery1357596158400="165">COURTENAY&mdash;CUPE workers at<a href="http://www.cupe.bc.ca/news/2857"> North Island College </a>have a new tentative collective agreement.&nbsp; The agreement, signed Dec. 5, 2012, is a four-year, no-concessions agreement with four 1 per cent wage hikes spread over the final two years.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The tentative contract is retroactive to 2010 and has no wage increase in the first two years in keeping with the provincial government&rsquo;s Net Zero Mandate which prevented any wage increases for public sector workers in 2010 and 2011. The agreement also includes housekeeping and language improvements.</p>
