<p jquery1354577602960="11">Members of the <a href="http://www.bcitfsa.ca/node/456">BCIT Faculty and Staff Association </a>(FSA) will resume strike action on December 3,<br />
	following the provincial government&rsquo;s refusal to respond to FSA requests to negotiate fair wages this past weekend.</p>
<p jquery1354577602960="11">&ldquo;The provincial government refuses to authorize BCIT to negotiate wages that match those of other post-secondary institutions.<br />
	The Minister of Advanced Education won&rsquo;t speak to us and the Premier has not made a move to invest in the people who will deliver her skills plan. Their silence this past weekend has left us with no choice but to return to the picket lines,&rdquo; said FSA President Teresa Place</p>
