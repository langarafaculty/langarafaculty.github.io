  being performed by people hired on a per course or limited term basis. These positions
  are often poorly paid, have little or no benefits, no job security and no academic

  for students, their regular academic staff colleagues, and&nbsp;universities and

  across the country in lending my support to Fair Employment Week to demand fairness
