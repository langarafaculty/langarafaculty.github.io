<p>Niall Christie is the LFA&#39;s&nbsp; representative to the FPSE Non-Regular Faculty Committee. On Oct 25 Niall attended a town hall meeting sponsored by FPSE and CAUT entitled &ldquo;Fair Employment Week Town Hall Meeting: Making Gains One Step at a Time&rdquo;. Attended by representatives from across BC, the meeting featured speakers, a panel and open discussion of issues affecting non-regular faculty and how locals are seeking to address their needs.
