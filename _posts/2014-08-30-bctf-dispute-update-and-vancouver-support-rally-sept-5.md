<p>To demonstrate support for the BC Teachers&rsquo; Federation over the next few weeks, the BC Federation of Labour has launched a series of efforts to raise awareness of the dispute, the issues are at the heart of negotiations, and provide venues for people to show their support.</p>
<p>A series of solidarity rallies will be held around the province starting next week, ending with a major rally in Vancouver on Friday, September 5. The rally begins at 5:00pm outside <a href="http://www.canadaplace.ca/At_Canada_Place/Getting_Here" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'map', 'resizable=yes,status=yes,location=yes,toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,fullscreen=yes,scrollbars=yes,dependent=no,width=500,left=400,height=450,top=200'); return false;">Cabinet Offices at Canada Place</a>. Please attend if you can - it&#39;s important to have a good show of support.</p>
<p>The BCFED has also launched a radio ad in support for BC&rsquo;s teachers and their effort to negotiate a fair deal and better learning conditions for kids. The ad will run from August 27 to September 2 in key media markets around the province, including the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>A new Insights West poll commissioned by BCFED shows that parents support BC&rsquo;s teachers 2-to-1 in the current dispute with the BC Liberal Government, and agree with teachers on key issues at the heart of the ongoing negotiations.
