<p>VANCOUVER&mdash;Three days of intense bargaining has produced a provincial framework deal for some &nbsp;CUPE college support workers. The template for agreement was reached late Sunday night by the College and Institutes Support Staff Bargaining Association (CISSBA) and the government&rsquo;s BC Post Secondary Employers&#39; Association.</p>
<p>&quot;This progress is a direct result of our coordinated job actions at Vancouver Island University, the College of New Caledonia, the College of the Rockies, North Island College and Camosun College,&quot; said CUPE Local 1858 (VIU) President Deborah Hopper. &quot;The ongoing unified actions by our collective team of institutions, including our two-day strikes, departmental shutdowns, rallies, and campus watch-dogging, kept the government serious in their work with us over those three long days of bargaining.&quot;</p>
<p>The CUPE Colleges Bargaining Committee (CCBC) was at the table representing more than 3,000 college support workers across the province.&nbsp; Also at the table&nbsp;as part of the CISSBA were representatives of the BC Government &amp; Service Employees&rsquo; Union and the Canadian Union of Office &amp; Professional Employees. &nbsp;CUPE also represents workers at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Langara College and Vancouver Community College through locals which were not involved in the weekend negotiations.</p>
