Note: 
<strong><span style="font-size:14px;">Although the LFA sent representatives to observe the bargaining process neither the LFA nor the College are signatories to this agreement.</span></strong>
A number of FPSE College locals met to negotiate a template agreement with the Post Secondary Employers Association (PSEA) last week. 
The employers for the special universities were not being represented by PSEA in these negotiations. 
The following is a Bulletin issued by FPSE about the conclusion of the template bargaining.

Early Saturday morning following four days of intense and focused bargaining with post-secondary education employers, the ten FPSE Faculty Associations participating at the template Bargaining Table reached a two-year deal on compensation.
