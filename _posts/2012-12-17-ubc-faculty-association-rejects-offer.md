<p>The University tabled an across-the-board (ATB) offer of 1.95% and 1.90%.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facultyassociation.ubc.ca/bargainingblog.php#B17">The Faculty Association</a> rejected this offer,&nbsp;saying that it&nbsp;would simply not allow catch up with settlements at major comparator universities, principally the University of Toronto, but would in fact result in faculty salaries at UBC falling further behind.&nbsp; A counter offer was made, which the University rejected.</p>
<p>The parties will meet again during the week of February 4th for mediated negotiations, which will culminate with an arbitrator ruling on outstanding issues, if any.</p>
