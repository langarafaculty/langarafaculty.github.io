<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong></p>

<p>Langara Faculty are worried about their students. Our students are in debt. They are exhausted. They are stressed. They are forced to spend <strong>too much time working and as a result have too little time to study.</strong> The financial stress on students is so great that Langara College is starting a <strong>food bank on campus.</strong></p>

<p><em>It was not always like this. </em>When many of us faculty got our degrees, the government covered 70-80% of costs, allowing us to focus on our studies.</p>

<p>In the last 15 years, provincial funding <strong>per student has dropped by 20% </strong>at Langara College (and similar amounts at institutions across the province). Without a change in direction, where will this trend end?</p>

<p>The BC government tells us that 78% of all new jobs will require a College or University education. So why cannot our students, the engine of BC&rsquo;s future economy, be allowed to focus on their studies?</p>

<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong></p>

<p>We need to<strong> restore BC government funding to public colleges and universities </strong>so students pay for their education over a lifetime (via taxes), not when they are making low wages and trying to study at the same time.</p>

<p>From February 20 to April 9, the Langara Faculty Association (LFA) is running a <strong>transit ad campaign to pressure political parties and to inspire voters </strong>to think of our students and BC&rsquo;s future when they <strong>vote on May 9</strong><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Help us spread the word: Tell your story on social media</em></strong></p>

<p>Students, parents and faculty intimately know the negative impact of this funding crisis. <strong>The general public and the politicians need to hear from us.</strong></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s tell them our stories. Let&rsquo;s make the transit ad campaign a launching pad for a social media campaign that will help make the funding crisis an election issue.</p>

<p><strong>Students, parents, faculty, get on your devices and share your struggles. </strong></p>

<p>How does the lack of funding affect your life? Your child&rsquo;s life? Your students&rsquo; lives?</p>

<p>Make a short video. Write a post. Take a selfie by one of our ads and make a statement. Be creative. Speak from the heart. <em>Tell your story</em>.</p>
