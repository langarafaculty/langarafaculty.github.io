<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">PRINCE GEORGE - <a href="http://www.cupe.bc.ca/news/2880">Cupe Local 4951</a> support workers and the College of New Caledonia have reached a tentative four-year collective agreement. The no-concessions deal is in line with the provincial BC colleges framework worked out between CUPE and the BC Post Secondary Employers&rsquo; Association (on behalf of the provincial government).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The agreement calls for no wage increases in the first two years, in keeping with the province&rsquo;s Net Zero Mandate for 2010- 2011. The agreement includes four one-per-cent wage increases spread over the final two years of the contract. The local has been without a new contract since 2010.</span></p>
<p jquery1357598052229="166"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The tentative agreement must still be ratified by the 340 members of CUPE 4591 and by the College of New Caledonia.</span></p>
