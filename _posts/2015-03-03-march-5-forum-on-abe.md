<p>The BC Liberal government has cut millions of dollars from adult education, so that now tuition fees for high school classes could be even more than for university courses.</p>

<p>That means doors of opportunity are closing for thousands of British Columbians.</p>

<p>FPSE, the BCTF and community allies are mobilizing to pressure the provincial government to restore full funding for ABE programs delivered by public post-secondary institutions. Please join the discussion with members of the public and from other locals at the Forum on March 5.</p>
