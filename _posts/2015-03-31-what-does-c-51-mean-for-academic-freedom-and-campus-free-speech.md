The proposed legislation would establish criminal offences that infringe upon the right to free expression. Security agencies would be granted unprecedented and intrusive powers to monitor and share information about Canadians, with no increase in oversight or accountability.</p>

<p>While much of the focus of the debate has rightly centred on the infringements on civil liberties generally, the legislation will also affect academic freedom and free speech on university and college campuses.
